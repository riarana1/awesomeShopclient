          eCommerce is a complex business. It involves many edge cases and a
          solid system architecture. This project is simply a demo demonstrating
          basic features which is only the tip of an iceberg. This project might
          ( and certainly does ) have bugs, vulnerabilities or some other types
          of issues. So, contributions are welcome :)
